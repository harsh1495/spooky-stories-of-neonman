# spooky-stories-of-neonman

DESCRIPTION: 
Engage yourself with the spooky adventures of Neonman, while collecting skulls and killing creepy ghosts. And more importantly, have fun.

INSTALLATION: 
Download the zip file on your desktop. Create a folder named Final_Game in your www directory of wamp server or htdocs directory of xamp server. Extract all the files from the zip to that folder.
Open the browser and enter the address : localhost/Final_Game

OBJECTIVE OF THE GAME:
The objective of the game is to clear the level with the agility of Neonman. On the way, keep collecting skulls for points. 
Also, kill those creepy ghosts by jumping over them. 
Use the arrow keys to jump over the obstacles and do not fall on the ground or you will lose your life (rather kill Neonman). 
Reach the winning flag and experience the winning moment and the cheers.

ARCHITECTURE: 
The architecture of the game is straightforward. I have used Phaser, a desktop and mobile HTML5 game framework. The game is divided into various states, each having it's own JavaScript file.
